### Greenify Web App


In today's world, it is hard to keep track of our environmental impact. While tools exist to calculate our carbon footprint, there's nothing available to encourage people to actually do it. Our application will try to make it fun to track your carbon footprint by introducing gaming elements.

###### Features:

* Track your carbon footprint
* Make better decisions by seeing what the impact of your choices will be
* See how others in your community are doing
* Encourage lowered carbon footprints by spurring competition with friends

#### Bell: Let's Greenify Our Communities!
